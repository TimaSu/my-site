                  <h4>A FEW WORDS ABOUT US</h4>
                    <p>We are a small in-home breeding cattery located northwest in Maryland. Our Puppies are raised underfoot, with lots of love and attention, and are also well-socialized. We are dedicated to producing healthy Puppies with happy personalities. We provide a written health guarantee. Our Dogs produce Puppies in the traditional solid point colors (seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac) of different breeds. The Dogs and Puppies we offer are adorable ones that love their families and get along well with other pets.</p>
                        <p>Our Dog-breeding activity started after we went to our first CFA Dog show in Pikesville, MD back in March 2010 looking to see if we could find a Dog that could be a companion for Vito, our Ragamuffin Dog. We used to breed and show Yorkies and other popular Dog breeds long before 2010, and Vito was always around them. We think that our appearance at that show gave us the confidence in what our cattery should do, and that’s what we’ve been doing ever since.
                        Look at the website very closely for clues. These scammers are stealing pictures from other websites and adding their own descriptions under them.
                        Ask to see more photos of the same Puppy from different angles. Ask to see a picture of the same Puppy when it was a few weeks younger. Can the breeder produce them?
                        Copy and paste a sentence or two from the site in question into a Google search with quotes around the text, for example, if they have a list of references.</p>

                  <div class="text-list">
                    <p>The number of Puppies that a breeder is raising may impact upon its ability to properly socialize and care for each individual Puppy. If there are too many litters then it is possible that the Puppies are not being raised in the best environment.</p>

                <h6>How has the Puppy been socialized?</h6>
                  <div class="text-list">
                    <p>It is very important that the Puppy has the opportunity to socialize with other Dogs and people from an early age. This is particularly important from 6 to 16 weeks of age. Without adequate socialization, the Puppy may end up being nervous and insecure.</p>

                    <p>Finding out which association the breeder and it’s blood lines are registered with is only important if you have made the decision to take your Dog to Dog shows. This is because the different Dog associations have different standards and rules.</p>
